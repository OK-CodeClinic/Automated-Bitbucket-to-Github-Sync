Are you traveling within the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands?

Xyrusse James at 18:07, Feb 13:
Hi Kehinde! Thanks for messaging with Delta. My name is Xyrusse James. I'll be happy to assist you with flight change!
You at 18:08, Feb 13:
My flight was cancelled by Delta, and i was asked to rebook the flight. My flight was 1 layover, now i rebooked with 2 layover. I want to change my flight back to only 1 layover in ATL.
Xyrusse James at 18:09, Feb 13:
I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you, Kehinde.
You at 18:10, Feb 13:
Thank You. Can you kindly help me make this changes effective?
Xyrusse James at 18:17, Feb 13:
I'll check this for you, just a moment.
Xyrusse James at 18:18, Feb 13:
I mean, I'm currently checking it.
You at 18:18, Feb 13:
Ok. Thank you. Awaiting to hear a response shortly
Xyrusse James at 18:21, Feb 13:
Thank you for patiently waiting, Kehinde! I have checked on my end, and changing your flight now will incur an additional fare collection. Since your flights are in April and still months away, our team will be changing your flight to a one-stop flight.
Xyrusse James at 18:21, Feb 13:
Rest assured that this will be fixed before your flights, Kehinde.
You at 18:23, Feb 13:
Thank you for the update, but I’d prefer this to be addressed now rather than waiting for an emergency fix closer to my travel date. Could you please make the necessary changes promptly? This will help me avoid any last-minute surprises or complications.

I appreciate your understanding and prompt assistance on this!
Xyrusse James at 18:24, Feb 13:
I understand, Kehinde. On my end, my hands are tied and I only have limited ability to change your flight. Only our team at the airport that is arranging the flights can process this on their end. Don't worry, the change will happen weeks before your scheduled flight.
You at 18:26, Feb 13:
Thank you for your response. I understand your limitations, but since I still have a remaining eCredit balance of $116, I’m confident this should cover any additional fare for the change.

Could you please escalate this to the appropriate team to process the change now? I would prefer not to wait until just before the flight to make adjustments. Your assistance in resolving this promptly would be greatly appreciated.
Xyrusse James at 18:28, Feb 13:
I'll find a way, Kehinde.
You at 18:28, Feb 13:
Thank you
Xyrusse James at 18:35, Feb 13:
Thank you for patiently waiting, Kehinde. Our only way will be transferring you to our ticketing team. I will transfer you now. Please keep the conversation open.
You at 18:35, Feb 13:
Ok
Info at 18:36, Feb 13:
You are being transferred to a Global Ticketing Support Representative queue along with a copy of this conversation. Our GTS team usually responds within 5 – 10 minutes, though wait times may vary.
Tonja at 18:37, Feb 13:
Hi! My name is Tonja. I see you were previously working with another agent. Please give me a moment to read through your conversation so I may continue where you left off. Is this okay?
You at 18:37, Feb 13:
Ok. Thank you
Tonja at 18:39, Feb 13:
I read that you had a schedule change and would like to change it back to a 1 stop layover, correct?
You at 18:39, Feb 13:
Absolutely correct
Tonja at 18:40, Feb 13:
I have the 1105am flight with 1 stop. Would that work for you?
You at 18:41, Feb 13:
Yes, it will work for me.
Tonja at 18:41, Feb 13:
And this is still on the 29th, correct?
You at 18:42, Feb 13:
28th, 29th and 30th. All good for me
Tonja at 18:42, Feb 13:
I have the 29th and there would be no difference in the fare.
You at 18:43, Feb 13:
Ok. That sounds great
Tonja at 18:43, Feb 13:
Perfect, give me just a few minutes and I will get that changed and reissued for you.
You at 18:43, Feb 13:
Thank you so much Tonja
Tonja at 18:46, Feb 13:
Do you prefer aisle or window seats?
You at 18:47, Feb 13:
Window seats are good
Tonja at 18:48, Feb 13:
Okay that is all changed and reissued for you. I just emailed you the changes and the App is updated as well.
You at 18:48, Feb 13:
Ok, i will check it out now
